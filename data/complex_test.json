If the month's name has 3 or 5 letters, write the month's name backwards.\n2. If the month has 31 days but does not fall under rule 1, replace the month's name with a physics equation (e.g., 'E=mc^2').\n3. If the month corresponds to a star sign Aquarius (January or February), place the entry for that month inside [ ].\n4. If the month corresponds to a star sign Virgo (August or September), place the entry for that month inside \" \".\n5.
